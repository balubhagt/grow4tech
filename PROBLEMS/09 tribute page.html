    <p>The Legend – Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
        In Maharashtra and across Bharat, Chhatrapati Shivajiraje Bhosle, the founder and ideal ruler of the Hindavi
        Empire, is revered as an all-inclusive, compassionate Monarch. He clashed with the regimes of Adilshah of
        Vijapur, Nizam of Ahmednagar, and even the most powerful Mughal Empire at the time, using the guerrilla war
        system, which was suitable for mountainous regions in Maharashtra, and sowed the seeds of the Maratha Empire.

        Despite the fact that the Adilshah, Nizam, and Mughal empires were dominant, they were completely reliant on
        local chiefs (sardars) – and killedars (Officers in-charge of Forts). The people under the control of these
        sardars and killedars were subjected to a great deal of distress and injustice. Shivaji Maharaj rid them of
        their tyranny and set an example of excellent governance for future kings to obey.</p>
